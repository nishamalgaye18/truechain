# True Chain

## Project Description

True Chain is a decentralized verification and trust system built on blockchain technology. It provides a transparent, immutable platform where users can submit claims about digital assets, documents, or any verifiable information, and have them verified by a network of trusted verifiers. The system creates an ecosystem of trust where reputation and consensus determine the validity of claims.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a world where digital trust is not dependent on centralized authorities but is instead built through community consensus and blockchain transparency. True Chain aims to eliminate fraud, reduce verification costs, and create a universal system for digital trust that can be used across industries, from academic credentials to product authenticity.

## Key Features

### 🔐 **Decentralized Verification System**
- Users can submit claims with cryptographic hashes of their data
- Multiple independent verifiers must confirm claims before approval
- Transparent verification process recorded on blockchain

### 👥 **Reputation-Based Verifier Network**
- Verifiers earn reputation points through accurate verifications
- Minimum reputation requirements ensure quality control
- Community-driven trust system without central authority

### 📊 **Comprehensive Claim Management**
- Complete claim lifecycle tracking from submission to verification
- Immutable timestamp records for all activities
- User-friendly claim retrieval and status checking

### 🛡️ **Security & Transparency**
- Smart contract-based logic ensures tamper-proof operations
- Public verification history for all claims
- Cryptographic data integrity through hash verification

### ⚡ **Efficient Consensus Mechanism**
- Configurable verification threshold (default: 3 verifiers)
- Prevents self-verification and duplicate voting
- Automatic claim approval upon reaching consensus
